1st block of the day
- it is supposed to be 90 minutes, I began late (by around 15 minutes)
- I've spent around 45 minutes in journaling to become more aware of the day
- resumed a survey on quantization, I'll focus a lot of effort here
2nd block of the day
- first hour spent reading the survey
- 15 minutes spent of paperswithcode.com because I'm procrastinating
- I'll spend the last 15 minutes for fun and other stuff focusing on optimizing the routine for the future
